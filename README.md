**Example**: test

```
./utility.sh test"

$1 is now test
$2 is now not-set
$3 is now not-set

â€”â€”> Hub is installed.
â€”â€”> Docker is installed.
â€”â€”> Date is: 2019-09-06_23H10s56
```

**Example**: test using attributes

```
./utility.sh test two "The red fox is running."

$1 is now test
$2 is now two
$3 is now The red fox is running.

â€”â€”> Hub is installed.
â€”â€”> Docker is installed.
â€”â€”> Date is: 2019-09-06_23H39s16
```

**Example**: git push

```
./utility.sh push

```

Now with a second attribute:

```
./utility.sh push "README / Add requirement section"
