# BashLava

BashLava makes your bash scripts a bunch of pieces of cakes. 

It's for developers that use git commands regularly. BashLava makes following git workflow a breeze without having to leave your terminal or use the GitHub GUI.

Technically speaking, it's a CLI utility *(or a CLI aggregator)*. It's not a CLI per se as it does not directly call APIs. The idea is to abstract a workflow to minimize the time to do some repetitive actions.

## See it in action

**Per example by typing these four commands**:

```
c "UPDATE: that thing that does X"
v 3.5.1
m 3.5.1
r 3.5.1
```

you will perform all these actions:

- push commits
- rebase or merge code to master (squash when needed)
- Generate CHANGELOG from commits and append the updates into the existing CHANGELOG
- Tag & push master branch
- push the release on Github with a template message
- reset your dev branch (to avoid any conflicts)

**It also allows you**:

- quickly set your custom scripts
- quickly write help function
- hack around it as it's all built with bash
- and more.

## Installation

You must create a symlink to your PATH for both files. Something like this:

```
ln -s /Volumes/myuser/Github/firepress-org/bashlava/bashlava.sh /usr/local/bin/bashlava.sh

ln -s /Volumes/myuser/Github/firepress-org/bashlava/.bashcheck.sh /usr/local/bin/.bashcheck.sh
```

Assuming your $path is `/usr/local/bin`

To confirm everything is running normally, run: `bashlava.sh test`

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/): (markdown viewer, password generator, lint checker, etc.)
- [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub#installation): needed to push release to Github.
- nano (brew install nano): needed to edit your changelog when the system prompt.
