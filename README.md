# BashLava

BashLaVa makes your bash scripts a bunch of pieces of cakes. 

It's for developers that use git commands regularly. BashLaVa makes following git workflow a breeze without having to leave your terminal or use the GitHub GUI.

In other word, **the Agile release cycle should be something you master. BashLaVa helps you to get there.**

Technically speaking, it's a CLI utility *(or a CLI aggregator)*. The idea is to abstract a workflow to minimize the time to do some repetitive actions.

The abstraction is deep. In *expert-mode* *(it means, you know what you do no question asked)*, you can accomplish all these steps in **one command**:

Context: you made few commits on your DEV branch. You are ready to release. So you need to:

1. **version** the project
2. **squash** + **rebase** + **merge** code to master (not squashing is possible as well)
3. Generate or **update the CHANGELOG**
4. **tag** with version & **push tag** to master branch
5. push the **release** on GitHub with a template message
6. **reset** your DEV (edge) branch (to avoid any conflicts)
7. Back to work for the next release!

In. One. Command.

For more explanations, check these videos:

- [BashLaVa - Introduction (step-by-step explanations)](https://youtu.be/jzGva3p7TeY)
- [Maintaining a real project with BashLaVA](https://youtu.be/J5ySPSTUgZA)
- [How to import your own custom bash-scripts into BashLaVa](https://youtu.be/ezY2N2Bdux0)
- [How to install BashLaVa on your Mac](https://youtu.be/g8pVr8-Cimw)

When starting with BashLava, I recommend to use these four commands:

```
c "UPDATE: that feat that does X"
v 3.5.1
m-
r
```


**It also allows you**:

- [quickly set your custom scripts](https://youtu.be/ezY2N2Bdux0)
- quickly write help function
- hack around  as it's all built with bash

## Installation

[Step-by-step on YouTube](https://youtu.be/g8pVr8-Cimw)

- 1) git **clone** this repo

- 2) **create a symlink** to your PATH for both files.

```
ln -s /Volumes/myuser/Github/firepress-org/bashlava/bashlava.sh /usr/local/bin/bashlava.sh

ln -s /Volumes/myuser/Github/firepress-org/bashlava/.bashcheck.sh /usr/local/bin/.bashcheck.sh
```

Assuming your $path is `/usr/local/bin`

- 3) **Test your installation**. run: `bashlava.sh test`

## Requirements

- A Mac. I didn't test BashLaVa on other systems. *Let's me know if you want to help for this :)*
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/): (markdown viewer, password generator, lint checker, etc.)
- [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub#installation): needed to push release to Github.
- nano (brew install nano): needed to edit your changelog when the system prompt.
