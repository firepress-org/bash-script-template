# BashLava

BashLava makes your bash scripts a bunch of piece of cakes. With it, you can quickly:

- push commits
- rebase or merge code to master (squash when needed)
- Generate CHANGELOG from commits and append the updates into the existing CHANGELOG
- Tag branch
- push the release on Github
- reset your dev branch (to avoid any conflicts)

It make following Git best practices a breeze without having to leave your terminal or use the GitHub GUI. You should try it, it's addictive.

I also allows you:

- quickly set your custom scripts
- quickly write help function
- hack around it as it's all built with bash
- and more.

### Motivation

WIP (VIDEO)

This core `bashcheck.sh` was forked from: https://github.com/ralish/bash-script-template
