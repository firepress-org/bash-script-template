# BACKLOG (Features)

As the project is young, instead of creating issues for FEATURE, BUG, etc., I'll maintain a backlog here. It's much quicker to draft these here (for the time seeing).

# 1) GLITCHES

- glow show read from ~/tmp/bashlava_help.md

# 2) NEXT FEATURES
	
- list functions from add-on
- show custom script to update a package.json version

# 3) NEED HELP

- No doubt, one day, I will!
