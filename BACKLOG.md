# BACKLOG (Features)

As the project is young, instead of creating issues for FEATURE, BUG, etc., I'll maintain a backlog here. It's much quicker to [draft these here](https://github.com/firepress-org/bashlava/blob/master/BACKLOG.md) for the moment.

# 1) GLITCHES

Can we generate a MD into a var and use App_glow to read the MD file ?

# 2) NEXT FEATURES
		
Produce new videos:
	- since `deploy` is simpler and without `m`
	
Don't write on disk!
	- App_update_changelog: 
	- help
		  
fct wip-sync-origin-from-upstream

option to list functions
	- from add-on

# 3) NEED HELP

- nothing special so far
