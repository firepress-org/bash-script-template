# BACKLOG (Features)

As the project is young, instead of creating issues for FEATURE, BUG, etc., I'll maintain a backlog here. It's much quicker to [draft these here](https://github.com/firepress-org/bashlava/blob/master/BACKLOG.md) for the moment.

# 1) GLITCHES

- glow show read from ~/tmp/bashlava_help.md or from a variable

# 2) NEXT FEATURES
		
- add rules to more fct
	- App_Is_Version_a_Valid_Number
	- App_Is_Input3_Empty_as_it_should

- Produce new videos: since `deploy` is simpler and without `m`
	
- Don't write on disk!
	- App_update_changelog: 
	- help
		
- if else logic ... 
	- add more FATAL error possibilities
  
- fct wip-sync-origin-from-upstream

- list functions from add-on

- show custom script to update a package.json version

# 3) NEED HELP

- nothing special so far
