# BACKLOG (Features)

As the project is young, instead of creating issues for FEATURE, BUG, etc., I'll maintain a backlog here. It's much quicker to draft these here (for the time seeing).

# 1) GLITCHES

- glow show read from ~/tmp/bashlava_help.md

- indent comments properly (no spacing)

# 2) NEXT FEATURES
		
update_changelog: don't write on disk
			
add rules to more fct
	- App_Is_Version_a_Valid_Number
	- App_Is_Input3_Empty_as_it_should
  
if else ... 
	- add more FATAL error possibilities
  
- fct wip-sync-origin-from-upstream

- list functions from add-on
- show custom script to update a package.json version

# 3) NEED HELP

- No doubt, one day, I will!
