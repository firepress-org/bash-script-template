# BACKLOG (Features)

As the project is young, instead of creating issues for FEATURE, BUG, etc., I'll maintain a backlog here. It's much quicker to [draft these here](https://github.com/firepress-org/bashlava/blob/master/BACKLOG.md) for the moment.

# 1) NEXT FEATURES
		
Produce new videos:
	- since `deploy` is simpler and without `m`
	
Don't write tmp files onto disk!
	- App_update_changelog: 
	- help
	- App_glow
		  
fct wip-sync-origin-from-upstream

ADD `list-all` to see fat from add-on

# 2) NEED HELP

Can we generate a markdown "file" and use App_glow without never write on disk (this is how we do it at the moment).

Make bash lava completly idempotent. Inspired by https://arslan.io/2019/07/03/how-to-write-idempotent-bash-scripts/

# 3) GLITCHES
